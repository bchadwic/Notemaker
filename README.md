<h1>Notemaker</h1>
<h2>In progress project: This program is an easy way to make multiple .txt notes by instantly saving / overwriting to a default pathway</h2>

<span>Things needed still</span>
<ul>
  <li>ability to use hot key bindings (F1, F2, F3)</li>
  <li>ability to open existing files</li>
  <li>better use of python classes / functions</li>
  <li>styling</li>
</ul>

<h4>Motivation:</h4>
<p>MS notepad became inefficient and slow for me to write multiple ideas down during class, work, or during a project. I came up with this idea which allows me to quickly set a filename, a path, and the text using function keys. This will cut wasted time on making sure my files are saved with the right name in the right location.</p>
